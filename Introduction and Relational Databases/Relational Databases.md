* A Database consists of a set of relations(tables)
* Each relation has a set of named attributes(column)
* Each tuple(row) has a value for each attribute
* Each attribute has a type(domain)
* Schema: the structure of the relation
* Key: attribute whose value is unique in each tuple, or set of attributes whose combinate values are unique
* Creating relations in SQL
