* selection operator: picks certain rows
* Project operator: pick certain columns
* Duplicates:
1. The semantics of relational algebra says that duplicates are always eliminated.
2. SQL is based on known as multi-sets or bags and that means that we don't eliminate duplicates, whereas.relational algebra is based on sets themselves and duplicates are eliminated.
* Cross-product: combine two relations
* Natural Join: enforce equality on all attributes with same name(eliminate duplicate attributes)
* Theta Join: 
* Union:
