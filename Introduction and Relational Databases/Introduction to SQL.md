## SELECT
```
select Attributs
from Table
where condition
```

* Combine two relations
```
select distinct sName,major # distince delete duplicate value 
from student, Apply
where Student.sID=Apply.sID # JOIN condtion
```
```
selection sname,GPA,decison
from Student,Apply
where Student.sID=Apply.sID and sizeHS<1000 and major='CS' and cname='Stanford'
```

* Ambiguous common attribute
```
select cName # both of college and apply have cName, covert to College.cName
from College,Apply
where College.cName=Apply.cName and enrollment>20000 and major='CS'
```
* Order results by one attribute or a set of attributes
```
select Student.sID,sName,GPA,Apply.cName,enrollment
from Student,College,Apply
where Apply.sID=Student.sID and Apply.cName=College.cName order by GPA desc, enrollment
```
* Predicate(string matching on attribute values)
```
select sID,major
from Apply
where major like '%bio%'
```
* present all attribute by `*`
* define attribute you want to see
```

## Table variables and set operators

* Table name
```

```
* Set operators
1.Union: by default, eliminates duplicates in its results
```
select cName from College
union # add all will present duplicates
selection sName from Student
```
2. intersect
```
select distinct sID from Apply where major='CS'
intersect
select sID from Apply where major='EE';
```
3. exception
```

* When you write a sub-query in the `select clause`, it's critical that sub-query return exactly one value, because the result
of that is being used to fill in just one cell of the result.

* when we include in the select clause of a grouping query, again if we go back to group by, and we put in the select clause an attribute that's not one of the grouping
attributes. It actually chooses a random value from the group to include

```

select cName

having count(*)<5

```

##  NULL VALUES
* `count` would not count NULL value
*  compare operations would not count NULL value
* when we right select the distinct GPA.We do include the null

## DATA modification statements
> insert, delete, update

* Insert
```
insert into Table
value (v1,v2,v3)

insert into table
selection statement
```
```
insert into Apply
select sID,'CMU','CS',NULL
from Student
where sID not in (select sID from Apply)
```
```
# admit CMU EE all students who were turned down in EE else where
insert into Apply
select sID 'CMU','EE','Y'
from Student
where sID in (select sID from Apply where major='EE' and decision='N')
```
* delete
```
delete from table
where condition
```
```
# delet all students who applied to more than two different majors
delete from Student
Where sID in (select sID
from Apply
group by sID
having count(distinct major)>2)
```
```
delete from College
where cName not in (select cName from Apply where major='CS')
```
* update
```
update table
set attr=expression
where condition

update table
set a1=expre1, a2=expre2...
where condition
```
```
update Apply
set decision='Y', major='economics'
where cName='CMU'
and sID in(select sID from Student where GPA<3.6)
```
```
update Apply
set major='CSE'
where major='EE'
and sID in
(select sID from Student
where GPA>=all
(select GPA from Student
where sID in(select sID from Apply where major='EE')))
```
```
update Student
set GPA=(select max(GPA) from student), sizeHS=(select min(sizeHS) from Student)
```

## JOIN
* Inner join on *condition* == theta join
1. join operator only be binary
```
select distinct sName,major
from Student, inner join Apply
on Student.sID=Apply.sID
```
2.join only for binary
```
# JOIN THRE TABLE
select Apply.sID, sName, GPA,Apply.cname,enrollment
from (Apply join Student on Apply.sID=Student.sID and ) join College
ON Apply.cName=College.cName
```
* Natural join: don't need explicity present common attributes
1. natural join eliminate duplicate attribute names
```
select distinct sName,major
from Student,Apply
where Student.sID=Apply.sID

select distinct sName,major
from Student, natural join Apply# natural join automatically apply equality 
```
```
select sName, GPA
from Student join Apply
on Student.sID=Apply.sID
where sizeHZ<1000 and major='CS'and cName='Standford'
```
* Inner Join *using* (attrs): explicitly lists the common attribues
1. same name but not equated: natural join implicity combines columns that have same name
```
select sName, GPA
from Student join Apply using(sID)
where sizeHZ<1000 and major='CS'and cName='Standford'
```
2. don't allow to have both `using` clause and an `on` clause(change to `where`)
3. any relations joined with itself gives you back the original relation

* outer join(left,right,full)
1. left outer join(dangling tuple):dangling tuple with no right matching tuple, still added to the result with NULL values
```
# some student didn't apply any school yet
select sName,sID,cName,major
from Student left outer join Apply using(sID)# join Student table

# without outer join operator
select sName,sID,cName,major
from Student,Apply
where Student.sID=Apply.sID
union
select sName,sID,NULL,NULL
from Student
where sID not in (select sID in Apply)
```
2. right outer: mathcing all right table tuples
```
# sID without name
select sName,sID,cName,major
from Student natureal right outher Apply
```
3. full outer: union
```
select sName,sID,cName,major
from Student full outer Apply

select sName,sID,cName,major
from Student right outher Apply using(sID)
union
select sName,sID,cName,major
from Student left outher Apply using(sID)

select sName,sID,cName,major
from Student,Apply
where Student.sID=Apply.sID
union
select sName,sID,NULL,NULL
from Student
where sID not in (select sID in Apply)
union
select NULL,sID,cName,major
from Apply
where sID not in (select sID in Student)
```
