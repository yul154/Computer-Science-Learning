# Phase 1: Programming Intensive Introduction to Java. 
* Weeks 1-4.
* One browser-based programming HW (this HW0 is optional).
* Three labs to introduce you to various tools (starting this week).
* Two projects (proj0 and proj1).
* Midterm 2/20 at 8:00 PM.

# Phase 2: Data Structures.
* Weeks 5-10.
* Incredibly important and foundational material: Expect an CS job interview to lean heavily on this part of the course.
* Two medium sized HWs (HW1, HW2) and one small HW (HW3).
  * Applications and deeper insight into data structures.
* One large project (Proj2A/2B), due ~3/18 and ~3/22.
* No autograder. You’re responsible for your code’s correctness.
* Standard labs implement data structures (e.g. hash table).
* Challenge labs are more like hard puzzles using data structures.

# Phase 3: Algorithms and Software Engineering
* Weeks 10-14
* Labs: Implement a basic algorithm (e.g. quicksort).
* Challenge labs: Hard data structures / algorithmic puzzles.
* One medium sized HW: Implement an AI that solves problems using A* algorithm.
* Two projects:
 1.Proj2C: BearMaps. Uses data structures from Proj2A/2B and algorithm from HW4 to implement a browser-based mapping application.
 2. Proj 3: Build Your Own World: An open ended project where you build a 2D world with physics according to your own design.
